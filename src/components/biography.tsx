            Hey there! I'm a software engineer with a story that kicked off during my high school days when 
            I jumped into the robotics team. That's when coding for robots opened the door to the mesmerizing 
            world of computer science for me.

            Since then, I've been on quite a ride. I tinkered with C# to create simulations at the University of South Florida's research lab. 
            Then, I joined JP Morgan's back end crew, working on a supercharged ticketing system.

            Lately, I've been all about DevOps at Citi, wrangling artifact storage like a champ. Curiosity keeps me going, and innovation keeps me hooked!
