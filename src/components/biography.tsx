            Hey there! Im a software engineer with a story that kicked off during my high school days when 
            I jumped into the robotics team. Thats when coding for robots opened the door to the mesmerizing 
            world of computer science for me.

            Since then, Ive been on quite a ride. I tinkered with C# to create simulations at the University of South Floridas research lab. 
            Then, I joined JP Morgans back end crew, working on a supercharged ticketing system.
